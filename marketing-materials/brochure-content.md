# The Revalidation Challenge

Every three years, UK nurses and midwives must complete the NMC revalidation process to maintain their professional registration. This requires documenting:

* **450 practice hours** (or 900 for dual registration)
* **35 hours of CPD** activities (including 20 participatory hours)
* **5 pieces of practice-related feedback**
* **5 written reflective accounts**
* **Reflective discussion** with another NMC registrant
* **Health and character declaration**
* **Professional indemnity arrangement**
* **Confirmation** from an appropriate person

For busy healthcare professionals, tracking and organizing these requirements often leads to:

* Last-minute scrambling to gather evidence
* Uncertainty about what meets NMC standards
* Hours spent formatting and preparing documentation
* Anxiety about potentially missing critical requirements
* Difficulty storing and accessing professional records
